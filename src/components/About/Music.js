                    I have the great pleasure of being from the town of Athens, Georgia 
                    and grew up enjoying the unique music scene that it provides. I have
                    played a variety of instruments for over fifteen years and music is truly 
                    my first love. Throughout my musical career, Iâ€™ve had many amazing collaboration 
                    experiences, which I accredit to influencing and forming my musical style, as well as 
                    helping me to become a better player.
