                    Gardening is one of lifeâ€™s simple pleasures and never fails to remind me that there are 
                    things that I can control and things that I cannot. There is nothing like the feeling of 
                    taking a seed from its humble beginnings, through patience and consistency in care, and 
                    watching it turn into a plant that yields a crop. Gardening is also a great reminder to 
                    slow down and enjoy the beauty around you as you work.
