                    My father first introduced me to chess when I was eight years old. To this day, 
                    the game captures my attention and I am amazed at how the principles Iâ€™ve observed from 
                    it can be applied to everyday life. The complexities of such a seemingly simple game provide 
                    for a challenging, yet enjoyable, pastime. The game of chess is something that I will continue
                    to enjoy and desire to improve in throughout my lifetime.
